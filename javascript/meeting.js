// John has invited some friends. His list is:

// Could you make a program that
// makes this string uppercase
// gives it sorted in alphabetical order by last name.
// When the last names are the same, sort them by first name. Last name and first name of a guest come in the result between parentheses separated by a comma.
// So the result of function meeting(s) will be:
// "(CORWILL, ALFRED)(CORWILL, FRED)(CORWILL, RAPHAEL)(CORWILL, WILFRED)(TORNBULL, BARNEY)(TORNBULL, BETTY)(TORNBULL, BJO
